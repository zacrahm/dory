#Redesigning the Layout

I chose to take a queue from Spotify here. 

Navigation of their app is done on the left drawer. 

The top of the app is dedicated to pervasive search and forward/back navigation controls. 

The main content area in Spotify is dedicated to search/browse results. They display several browsing options even once you've searched for a field, since there are sub categories of results you may be interested in.

The right drawer presents notification information, which will be interesting to watch changes in device status or configuration retrieval.
